# GraphQL React Application

## Description :clipboard:
> A GraphQL workshop to learn GraphQL implementations in JavaScript,

## GraphQL App DEMO :video_camera:

## Built With :zap:
1. GraphQL
2. React
3. Apollo Client
4. External dependency [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) ( for master branch )
5. Express
6. Node js
7. create-react-app ( uses Babel and Webpack )

## Details :scroll:

1. :arrow_right: We will use [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) WordPress plugin that brings the power of GraphQL to WordPress and creates a single endpoint for us at `http://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql` for all our queries
2. :arrow_right: We will use [wp-graphiql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql) WordPress plugin that gives us a GraphiQL playground avaiable from your WordPress Dashboard. 
2. :arrow_right: React application is set up using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) ( that runs webpack-dev-server for the frontend on `localhost:3000` )
6. :arrow_right: We have used Apollo Client to build UI in React that fetches data from GraphQL. Apollo client help us create a query and binds our React component with the query, so that when component renders, and handles any queries to GraphQl server and return the results.
7. :arrow_right: We import `Apolloclient` from `apollo-boost` and create a new object called `client` and pass the url `http://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql` for our GraphQL endpoint into this object.
8. :arrow_right: We wrap our main React Component `<AppoloProvider>` and apollo `client` is then passed to these components, so that the results of your query can be passed to your components.
9. :arrow_right: The `graphql-tag` ( graphQl query parsing utility ) is installed and `gpl` is imported from it. The `gpl` parses GraphQL query strings into the standard GraphQL AST.
10. :arrow_right: Use `gpl` to query the data in front react app, from the endpoint created by `wp-graphql` plugin on WordPress.
11. :arrow_right: We import `graphql` from `react-apollo` to bind apollo to react like so `export default graphql( yourQuery )( YourComponent )` This will make the query results available in props of the component.
12. :arrow_right: We have displayed all the data received as response of the query on home page( `Home.js` ).

## Installation :wrench:

1. Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/imranhsayed/graphql-workshop`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`


## Plugins for GraphQL with WordPress :electric_plug:

Clone these repositories into plugin directory of your WordPress Install and activate them from WordPress dashboard.

1. [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql)
2. [wp-graphiql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql)

## Instructions :point_right:

* `Graphiql` is a tool that we can use as a client to make request to our server.
 It will be available in WordPress dashboard, when you install 
 
 * Put this code in `functions.php` of your WordPress theme to allow cross origin request.
 
 ```$xslt
function my_customize_rest_cors() {
    remove_filter( 'rest_pre_serve_request', 'rest_send_cors_headers' );
    add_filter( 'rest_pre_serve_request', function( $value ) {
        header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' );
        header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE' );
        header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true' );
        header( 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Link', false );
        return $value;
    } );
}
add_action( 'rest_api_init', 'my_customize_rest_cors', 15 );
``` 

## Common Commands :computer:

You can run these commands from root directory.

1. `npm run dev` runs webpack-dev-server for frontend on port 3000 in watch mode
2. `npm run prod` runs the build for production for client.

## Useful Links :link:

1. [Express GraphQL github link](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)
2. [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) 

Apollo Client is way to use GraphQL to build client applications. It helps you build a UI that fetches data with GraphQL, and can be used with any JavaScript front-end.
When two components need the same data. If an action triggers an update on update, the second one wonâ€™t be updated . Apollo solves this using `reactive cache` feature.
Its main job is fetch some GraphQL queries and keep them in sync with one another
